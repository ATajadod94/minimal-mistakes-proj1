## About

In a collaboration of over 20 researchers across UC Berkeley, Intesa Sanpaolo, IBM Research, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Stanford, our mission is to broadly understand the key technical challenges for industry-grade agentic AI systems and to build bridges between academic innovation with industry realities and the AI and Systems research communities. See below on ways to participate.

From this study, we hope to steer our own and the field's research toward solving the most impactful industry problems versus purely academic problems for building and running agentic AI systems, initially through papers and blogs synthesizing our findings.

## Ways to Participate

- Share and promote your repositories, publications, blogs, etc.
- Anonymously answer high-level questions from your experience with Agentic AI systems
- Sign-up for an in-depth discussion of your use-cases and challenges you would like to solve.
