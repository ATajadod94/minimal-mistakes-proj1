## Welcome to Our Research Collaboration

In a collaboration of over 20 researchers across UC Berkeley, Intesa Sanpaolo, IBM Research, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Stanford, our mission is to broadly understand the key technical challenges for industry-grade agentic AI systems and to build bridges between academic innovation with industry realities and the AI and Systems research communities.

From this study, we hope to steer our own and the field's research toward solving the most impactful industry problems versus purely academic problems for building and running agentic AI systems, initially through papers and blogs synthesizing our findings.

### Key Research Areas

- **Industry-Grade Agentic AI Systems** - Understanding technical challenges for real-world deployment
- **Academic-Industry Bridge** - Connecting research innovation with practical applications  
- **Cross-Institutional Collaboration** - Leveraging expertise across 5 major institutions
- **Impact-Driven Research** - Focusing on solving the most impactful industry problems
